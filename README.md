## Classification of Emails Into Spam And Ham With R

This is an assignment for my STA141B (Data & Web Technologies for Data Analysis) class in UC Davis taught by Prof. Duncan Temple Lang. The goal of this assignment is to gain some understanding in the basics of Natural Language Processing (NLP) by obtaining useful information from emails using Regex in R. 

The codes used in this analysis are contained in `codes.R` and the results and analysis are discussed in `report.pdf`.
